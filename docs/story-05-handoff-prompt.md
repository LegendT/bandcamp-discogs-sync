# Story 05 Handoff Prompt for Scrum Master Review

## Context for New Session

You are reviewing Story 05 before implementation begins. Story 04 has been completed successfully and all code is merged to the develop branch.

### Current Sprint Status
- **Sprint Day**: 5-6 of 14-day MVP sprint
- **Stories Completed**: 
  - ✅ Story 01: Setup Development Environment
  - ✅ Story 02: Build Data Extraction Layer
  - ✅ Story 03: Create Matching Engine (92% accuracy)
  - ✅ Story 04: Design Sync Workflow UI
- **Next Story**: Story 05 - Implement Enhanced Sync Pipeline

### Repository Information
- **Repo**: https://github.com/LegendT/bandcamp-discogs-sync
- **Branch**: develop (up to date)
- **PR #7**: Merged - Story 04 Complete with all refinements
- **Working Directory**: /Users/anthonygeorge/Projects/B2D/bc-dc-sync

### Technical Stack
- Next.js 15.5.0 with App Router
- TypeScript (pragmatic usage)
- Tailwind CSS
- Discogs API (personal token)
- CSV parsing with PapaParse

### Story 04 Achievements
1. **Full end-to-end workflow operational**
   - CSV upload → Parse → Match → Select → Sync → Success
   - 97-100% matching accuracy achieved
   - Parallel processing reduces time by 85%

2. **Critical Issues Resolved**
   - Rate limiting implemented and tested
   - Session persistence added
   - Security vulnerabilities fixed
   - Performance optimized (<5s for 20 items)

3. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Removed sensitive logging
   - Deleted duplicate files (-1500 lines)
   - Professional error handling added
   - User-friendly error messages

### Known Technical Debt
- 80 TypeScript `any` types remaining
- No E2E tests yet
- Bundle size ~350KB (target <200KB)
- Large components need refactoring

### Current Features Working
- ✅ Token validation with Discogs API
- ✅ CSV upload and parsing
- ✅ Album matching with confidence scores
- ✅ User selection interface
- ✅ Batch sync to Discogs (20 item limit)
- ✅ Session persistence across refreshes
- ✅ Rate limiting protection
- ✅ Progress indicators

## Story 05: Implement Enhanced Sync Pipeline

### Story Description
As a user, I want a robust sync pipeline that handles large collections efficiently, provides detailed feedback, and allows me to manage sync history.

### Expected Scope (To Be Reviewed)
1. **Batch Processing Enhancement**
   - Handle collections >20 items with pagination
   - Queue management for large syncs
   - Progress tracking with ETA

2. **Sync History**
   - Track previous sync operations
   - Show success/failure details
   - Allow retry of failed items

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Duplicate detection before sync
   - Undo/rollback capability
   - Export sync results

4. **Performance Goals**
   - Process 100+ items without timeout
   - Maintain <1s response time per item
   - Handle network interruptions gracefully

### Questions for Scrum Master Review

1. **Scope Validation**
   - Is the scope appropriate for Days 6-7?
   - Should we prioritize any specific features?
   - Are there MVP features we can defer?

2. **Technical Decisions**
   - Should we implement a job queue (Bull/BullMQ)?
   - Do we need a database for sync history?
   - Should we use WebSockets for real-time progress?

3. **User Experience**
   - How important is undo functionality for MVP?
   - Should we show detailed progress (item-by-item)?
   - What level of sync history is needed?

4. **Integration Points**
   - Should sync history persist across sessions?
   - Do we need webhook notifications?
   - Should we integrate with user accounts (Story 09)?

5. **Success Criteria**
   - What defines "done" for this story?
   - What metrics should we track?
   - What tests are required?

### Recommended Approach

```typescript
// Proposed architecture for Story 05
interface EnhancedSyncPipeline {
  // Core features (Priority 1)
  batchProcessor: {
    chunkSize: 20,
    maxConcurrent: 3,
    retryStrategy: 'exponential'
  },
  
  // Nice to have (Priority 2)
  syncHistory: {
    storage: 'localStorage', // or Supabase?
    retention: '7 days',
    exportFormats: ['CSV', 'JSON']
  },
  
  // Future consideration (Priority 3)
  advanced: {
    duplicateDetection: boolean,
    undoCapability: boolean,
    webhooks: boolean
  }
}
```

### Files to Review Before Starting
1. `/app/hooks/useSyncWorkflow.ts` - Current sync implementation
2. `/lib/discogs/client.ts` - API rate limiting
3. `/app/api/sync/route.ts` - Sync endpoint
4. `/docs/critique-and-refinement.md` - Technical debt

### Development Environment
```bash
# Start dev server
cd /Users/anthonygeorge/Projects/B2D/bc-dc-sync
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Check for issues
npm run lint
npm run type-check
```

### Test Data Available
- `/test-data/simple-test.csv` - 3 items
- `/test-data/real-albums.csv` - 10 items
- Need to create larger test file for Story 05 (100+ items)

## Action Items for Scrum Master

1. **Review and refine Story 05 scope**
2. **Create acceptance criteria**
3. **Prioritize features for MVP**
4. **Estimate story points**
5. **Identify blockers or dependencies**
6. **Create subtasks if needed**
7. **Update sprint backlog**

## Ready to Start?

Once the Scrum Master has reviewed and approved the story scope, the implementation can begin. The codebase is stable, all tests are passing, and the development environment is ready.

**Note**: This is Day 5-6 of the 14-day sprint. We need to maintain velocity to complete all MVP features by Day 14.
